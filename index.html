    <p>Hello! My name is Martin Rodney Hansen. I grew up in the Seattle Washington area but recently moved to Middleton Idaho. I am 20 years old as of September 24th 2022. I am a highschool dropout but have completed my GED. I have worked a multitude of jobs ranging from gymnastics instructor, apprentice butcher, and most recently home lighting repair technician. My favorite food is any mexican food but particularly burritos or enchiladas. My primary goal in life is to own a house and have a big family. My favorite color is green and currently live as the most humble person alive!</p>
